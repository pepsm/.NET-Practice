# Data Structures

> Storage format that enable us to access and modificate it efficiantly.
> It's an abstract collection of data values, and relationship among them.


### Node 

>  A basic unit, which often is implemented by pointers.

[ **next** ][ **value** ][ **tail** ]

### Linked List

> Linear data structure where every element is a separeted object [node](). 
> Each element is linked using pointers. 
> Each node of a list is made up of two items - the **value** and a **reference** to the next node.

### Doubly Linked list 

> It is a type of linked list in which **each node** apart from storing its data **has two references**.
